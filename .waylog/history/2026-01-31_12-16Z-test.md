<permissions instructions>Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted. Network access is enabled. Approvals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. `approval_policy` is `never`: This is a non-interactive mode where you may NEVER ask the user for approval to run commands. Instead, you must always persist and work around constraints to solve the task for the user. You MUST do your utmost best to finish the task and validate your work before yielding. If this mode is paired with `danger-full-access`, take advantage of it to deliver the best outcome for the user. Further, in this mode, your default testing philosophy is overridden: Even if you don't see local patterns for testing, you may add tests and scripts to validate your work. Just remove them before yielding.</permissions instructions>

Got it. What would you like me to test (and how) in `d:\unify codes\uniUAT`?
